                        Hi! My name is Anand Chaudhary. I was born in Nepal in the year 1990.
                        I moved to the United States when I was 19 years of age, in the
                        year 2010. I was still pursuing my bachelors degree when I got the
                        opportunity to come to the US. I decided to complete my degree and
                        I did so in the year 2012 and secured my Bachelors of Business
                        Administration from the prestigious 178 years old college with
                        rich curriculum, culture and diversity called the Madras Christian
                        College.
                    </p>

                        One thing I really love about myself is my passion for learning
                        new things. I think without this curiosity I would just be an
                        empty shell of a person, just hollow on the inside. I have never
                        stopped learning and will continue to do so till the end of my
                        life. I love to play music, dance, sing, cook delicious food,
                        write stuff, being on my laptop, outdoor sports, travelling,
                        photography, creating arts and be in the midst of nature whenever
                        time permits. I can also speak 6 different languages namely
                        English, Nepali, Hindi and Urdu, Maithili, Tamil and understand
                        Bengali to some degree. I can also play about 5 different musical
                        instruments such as guitar, harmonica, trumpet, drums, a little
                        bit of piano. Guitar off course is my favourite.

                        In my professional life I have worn several hats from being a
                        school teacher to a sales person, a young businessman to a sales
                        support specialist in an optical cabling manufacturing facility
                        and even working as a Production Supervisor at Samsung. I felt the
                        need to grow as an individual and do more challenging ventures in
                        life and I found my new passion in my life as a Web Developer. I’m
                        intrigued by the fact of how powerful my computer is and things I
                        can build with it. Now, I have completely invested and dedicated
                        my time in the world of Information Technology learning
                        programming languages and technologies in the field of
                        <b>full stack web development</b>. Every single day I’m
                        exponentially growing as a developer learning new tools and
                        technologies and integrating them into my projects. Initially I
                        started coding in the early 2017 and started as a Business Analyst
                        trainee and the more I learned about the application development
                        and product requirements the more interested I got towards
                        programming. For this reason, I joined the coding bootcamp at
                        Northwestern University and can proudly say it was one of the best
                        decisions I've made because I’ve learned so many new concepts,
                        tools and technologies to build applications that I could not even
                        imagine of.
